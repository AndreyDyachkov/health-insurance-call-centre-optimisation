# **Health Insurance Call Centre Optimisation — Analytics Case Study**

This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project focused on improving the performance of a **health insurance medical call centre**.
It demonstrates practical application of **SQL**, **Power Query**, **Excel**, **DAX**, and **operational analytics** to identify inefficiencies, optimise staffing, evaluate outsourced provider performance, and improve customer experience.

---

## **Project Overview**

Following the onboarding of a large corporate client, the call centre experienced a rapid increase in call volumes. This created several issues:

* Missed-call rates rose to **20%**
* Average answer time exceeded **1 minute**
* No visibility into peak hours or workload distribution
* Outsourced call-centre performance appeared unreliable
* Call-type classification lacked consistency
* CSAT data existed but was unused for trend analysis

This project builds a structured reporting and analysis framework to support daily operational management and strategic decisions.

## **Objectives**

* Automate ETL workflows for daily data refresh
* Consolidate CCaaS, internal SQL data, and outsourced call-centre reports
* Analyse call volumes, answer times, missed calls, and SLAs
* Evaluate outsourced provider efficiency
* Break down call categories and subtypes
* Build customer satisfaction (CSAT) analytics with moving averages
* Deliver clear reporting for non-technical stakeholders

---

## **Key Insights**

* Late evenings on working days had the **highest answer times** and **missed-call rates**
* Outsourced call centre returned **up to 70%** of overflow calls back to the main line
* Most calls were medical requests; service-approval calls dominated the volume
* A large proportion of calls were tagged as **“Other”**, signalling classification issues
* CSAT remained relatively high despite response-time challenges
---

## **Results & Impact**

* Missed-call rate decreased from **20% → ~5%**
* Outsourced provider performance improved significantly
* Staffing aligned more accurately with hourly demand
* Reporting became faster, clearer, and more actionable
* Key operational KPIs became visible for the first time
